# AGENTS.md -- ETHGlossary

Conventions for any agent (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, OpenAI Codex, others) working in this repo.

## What this repo is

ETHGlossary is a standalone API and HTML viewer for canonical Ethereum terminology, deployed on Cloudflare Workers. Three consumers:

- Humans browsing the viewer at `/`
- LLMs and tooling consuming `/openapi.json` and `/llms.txt`
- Translation pipelines POSTing source content to `/api/v1/filter` to get matching terms back.

Two product surfaces:

- **English style guide** -- 521 terms with casing rules, avoid lists, aliases, editorial notes. Authoritative for "what is the right way to write `<term>`?"
- **Translation reference** -- 24 languages with contextual forms (prose, heading, tag, UI), plurals, grammar, confidence levels, and a v1-locked transliteration policy covering 13 non-Latin-script languages.

Live deployment: `https://ethglossary.visual-20-hoists.workers.dev` (transitional; custom domain `ethglossary.xyz` is owned and will be pointed at the Worker). The repo is `github.com/wackerow/ethglossary` and will eventually move to the `ethereum` org. Consumers should call the URL, not the GitHub path.

## Stack

- **Hono** `^4.12.x` -- edge-deployable web framework
- **@hono/zod-openapi** `^1.3.x` -- routes defined with Zod; OpenAPI 3.1 auto-generated
- **@scalar/hono-api-reference** -- interactive docs at `/docs`
- **Cloudflare Workers** + `wrangler` CLI -- deploy target
- **TypeScript 5.x**, ESM, no build step beyond what wrangler does

Auto-generated OpenAPI from the same Zod schemas used for runtime validation is a real win. Do not migrate to Next.js or another framework without strong reason. See `docs/design-decisions.md` if tempted.

For exact request/response shapes use `/openapi.json` as the source of truth.

### Intelligent term resolution

`/style-guide/{termId}` and `/translations/{lang}/{termId}` resolve via a surface-form index built at module load. Lookup order:

1. Canonical term name (case-insensitive)
2. `forms.base`
3. Aliases (string or object form)
4. Avoid-list entries (so `on-chain` resolves to `onchain`)

Misses return 404 with a `suggestions` array.

## Top gotchas -- read before touching data

Full annotated list in `docs/gotchas.md`. Highest-impact items:

1. **Translation files are keyed by canonical term name, NOT by `id` slug.** Master `confirmed_terms` key = `"proxy contract"`. Translation file key = `"proxy contract"`. Term `id` = `"proxy-contract"`. When joining master and translations, use `Object.keys(getTerms())`, never `t.id`. A production bug from mixing these once reported every language as ~60% complete.

2. **Three different `script_rule` value sets currently coexist.** The JSON Schema enum (v1-aligned: 6 values), the bundled data (6 values including legacy `hybrid`/`context_dependent` until they are migrated), and the v1 translation policy target (6 values). Before touching `script_rule`, load `docs/data-shape.md` for the reconciliation table.

3. **`category` is currently topical** (`scaling`, `defi`, `consensus`, etc., 15 values) but the v1 translation policy uses `category` as **term role** (`concept`, `brand-or-project`, etc., 11 values). Migration is in progress; do not silently switch.

4. **Aliases can be strings OR objects.** Most are `{ term, status, note? }`; some legacy entries are bare strings. Always normalize:
   ```typescript
   const aliasStr = typeof a === "string" ? a : a.term
   ```

5. **Translation files have 9 orphan entries.** Files contain 541 entries; master has 532. The orphans are morphological variants, DRY pattern members and abbreviations -- deliberate, not stale. Filter at the API layer (already done in `routes/translations.ts`). Do not assume key-set parity. See `docs/gotchas.md` section 5.

6. **Confidence is optional in data; runtime defaults to `"high"`.** Default to `"high"` when reading directly from JSON or types break.

7. **OpenAPI server URL is derived at request time.** Do not hardcode any domain in the spec.

8. **Worktree hazards.** If this codebase is a worktree of a parent monorepo: do NOT run `git remote remove origin` -- it touches the parent. Use `--ignore-workspace` or rely on the empty `pnpm-workspace.yaml` for `pnpm install`.

## Working preferences -- non-negotiable

These come from the repo owner. They are not negotiable. The reasoning matters because it lets you handle edge cases.

### Permission is single-use, never in perpetuity

"Go ahead and commit" authorizes ONE commit. "Push it" authorizes ONE push. "Deploy" authorizes ONE deploy. Do not chain operations. Do not assume that approval for an earlier change extends to the next change. Combining operations has cost trust in the past.

### Commit and push are separate steps

Always commit first, show the result, wait for explicit go-ahead, then push.

### Never auto-commit

"Make this change" / "fix this bug" / "add this feature" is NOT permission to commit. Edit the files. Show the diff. Wait.

### Plain ASCII commit messages

No em dashes, smart quotes, fancy hyphens, or Unicode in commit messages. Use `--` for ranges if needed. Straight quotes only.

### Commit subject conventions

- Maximum 50 characters
- Lowercase
- Verb-prefix, imperative
- Allowed prefixes: `add:` (new feature), `fix:` (bug fix), `refactor:` (no behavior change), `docs:`, `chore:`, `test:`

The body explains WHY, not WHAT. The diff already shows what changed.

### Co-author lines

Every commit ends with two co-author lines:

```
Co-Authored-By: Claude <model-name> <noreply@anthropic.com>
Co-Authored-By: wackerow <54227730+wackerow@users.noreply.github.com>
```

Do NOT add version variants in the Claude line ("1M context", etc.) -- the user considers it unnecessary noise.

### Short responses by default

State results and decisions directly. Skip self-narration. Long replies only when warranted.

### Disclaim confidence honestly

"I am moderately confident" / "I have not verified X" / "I think this works but have not tested it" are welcome. False certainty is not.

### No "you're absolutely right" or apologies

Patronizing. Engage with substance. If correct, acknowledge specifically. If incorrect, push back. No social-ritual apologies; just state the mistake and the fix.

### Open-source / privacy / ethics priorities

In priority order:

- Avoid Google products and Google-touched dependencies entirely.
- Avoid OpenAI and Amazon equally.
- Avoid technologies that further empower already-wealthy/powerful entities.
- Prioritize FLOSS / open-source tooling.
- Prioritize privacy and individual freedom.
- Cloudflare for hosting is fine.

No telemetry / analytics may be added without explicit ask.

## The viewer

The human-facing site is server-rendered with `hono/jsx` under `src/ui/`,
mounted by `src/routes/viewer.tsx`. Styling is **Tailwind v4**, compiled from
`src/ui/app.css`. There is no client framework; interactivity is three
vanilla-JS islands -- `src/ui/islands.ts` (term filtering), `src/ui/tooltip.ts`
(click-to-explain popovers) and `src/ui/nav-drawer.ts` (the mobile menu).
Every script the site ships totals about 2.5 KB gzipped.

Rules that are easy to get wrong:

- **Never link an external font host.** Fonts are self-hosted woff2 subsets
  under `public/fonts`, generated by `scripts/build-fonts.mjs`. Every face
  carries a `unicode-range`, so a page downloads only the scripts it renders.
  CJK is the one exception and is deliberately NOT self-hosted -- see the
  `--font-cjk` comment in `app.css`.
- **Use the theme scale, not arbitrary values.** `@theme` in `app.css` names
  every color and text size after the thing it is in Figma -- `text-h1`,
  `text-label-md`. Reach for `text-[19px]` only when the design genuinely has
  no token for it. Prefer a standard Tailwind token over a custom one:
  `max-w-3xl`, never `max-w-[555px]`.
- **`@theme` has two layers, and only the first holds a hex.** The palette
  layer is scale-named and never themed (`--color-yellow-400`,
  `--color-plum-700`). The semantic layer names roles, and every themed value
  is a single `light-dark()` pair (`--color-background`, `--color-foreground`,
  `--color-border`). Add a role, not a hex, and never name a token after the
  one element it is used on.
- **`light-dark()` resolves against `color-scheme`,** which is why the two
  blocks at the bottom of `app.css` set `color-scheme` rather than redefining
  colors: `@media (prefers-color-scheme: light)` guarded with
  `:root:not([data-theme="dark"])`, and `:root[data-theme="light"]` for the
  explicit toggle. Do NOT add `dark:` variants. `light-theme:` is a
  `@custom-variant` for the rare case that needs to branch on markup rather
  than color.
- **`--color-primary` is a fill, `--color-accent` is for text.** The brand
  yellow measures 1.21:1 on the light ground. `accent` swaps to a same-hue
  darker step there; `primary` stays yellow because it always sits behind
  dark text.
- **URLs to Discord, GitHub, X, Farcaster or ethereum.org come from
  `src/lib/constants.ts`.** Never inline them. ETHGlossary has no social
  accounts of its own -- X and Farcaster point at ethereum.org's.
- **Never hardcode the site's own origin.** It is `workers.dev` today and
  `ethglossary.xyz` later. Canonical links, `og:*` URLs, `robots.txt` and
  `sitemap.xml` all take it from the request via `pageUrl()` in
  `src/routes/viewer.tsx`.
- **External links go through `<ExternalLink>`** in `src/ui/link.tsx`, which
  adds `target="_blank"`, the `rel` pair, and Lucide's external-link marker.
  Pass `hideArrow` for icon-only links, and always give those an `aria-label`.
- **Term URLs are built from `id`, and `id` is indexed separately.**
  `resolveTerm()` indexes the canonical key, `forms.base`, aliases and avoid
  forms -- plus the `id` slug in a final pass. That last pass is what makes
  the 200-of-532 terms whose id differs from their key reachable at all.
- **Icons are Lucide imports at the call site.** `import thumbsUp from
  "lucide-static/icons/thumbs-up.svg"`, then `<Icon svg={thumbsUp} />`. The
  wrangler Text rule resolves the import to source text, so there is no
  registry to update and nothing to copy into the repo. `src/ui/icons/` is
  for custom art only -- today the brand marks Lucide does not ship.
- **A table row with one link is clickable end to end.** Put `data-row-link`
  on the `<tr>` (plus `group cursor-pointer`) and let `src/ui/row-link.ts`
  widen the hit area; the `<a>` itself is untouched, so keyboard and screen
  reader behaviour is exactly the link's. Two things NOT to do: an `<a>` in
  every `<td>` with `aria-hidden` on the duplicates works for a mouse and
  hides the cells' content from a screen reader; and a stretched `::after`
  over a `position: relative` row is silently ignored by WebKit when the
  table is `border-collapse: collapse`, which lets the overlay escape to the
  initial containing block and swallow taps across the whole page.
- **Reach for the platform before writing behavior.** The mobile drawer is a
  `<dialog>` opened with `showModal()`, so the focus trap, page inertness,
  Escape, focus restoration and the backdrop are the browser's, and its
  transition is `@starting-style` plus `allow-discrete` rather than a
  animation library. The token layer follows shadcn's naming convention, but
  shadcn's components are React and this site has no client framework -- see
  `docs/design-decisions.md`.
- **A gated control is `aria-disabled`, never `disabled`.** A disabled element
  fires no click event, so it cannot explain why it is inert. Give it
  `data-tip` (plus `readonly` on a field) and `src/ui/tooltip.ts` shows the
  reason on click -- which is the only thing that works on touch, where
  `title` never fires.
- **Definitions carry HTML.** Run them through `sanitizeDefinition()` from
  `src/lib/sanitize.ts` -- stripping tags produces run-on sentences, and
  community-submitted content will flow through the same components later.
- **Slot counts vary.** Use `applicableContexts()` from
  `src/lib/context-types.ts`; never hardcode six. See `docs/context-types.md`.

### Viewer routes

| Route | What it is |
|---|---|
| `/` | Landing page |
| `/style-guide` | Every English term, filterable client-side |
| `/style-guide/:termId` | One term: definition, casing, and its prose form in all 24 languages |
| `/translations` | The picker: coverage per language, plus an "All languages" row |
| `/translations/all` | All languages at once. A term picker; nothing here is votable |
| `/translations/all/:termId` | One term across 24 languages x every applicable context |
| `/translations/:lang` | One language: the contributor view |
| `/translations/:lang/:termId` | One term in one language, with the vote controls |
| `/translations/change` | Clears the stored language and returns to the picker |
| `/contexts` | What prose / heading / tag / ui / code / plurals mean |
| `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml` | Crawler surface. Everything is allowed |

Rules that are not obvious from the table:

- **`/languages` and `/translate/*` are gone.** Picking a language and
  reviewing one were two tabs pointing at one task. They 301 to their
  `/translations` equivalents, from the `MOVED` table at the bottom of
  `viewer.tsx`, which is registered after the real routes so it can never
  shadow one. Do not reintroduce the old paths.
- **`/translations` does not redirect.** The nav is what routes a reader with
  a stored language straight to `/translations/:lang` -- see `navHref()` in
  `layout.tsx`.
- **Feedback is always cast against one language.** `/translations/all` is
  read-only by construction and says so on the page. Do not add vote controls
  to it.

## Adding a glossary term

Read `docs/data-shape.md` and `docs/term-template.json` first. Then:

1. Decide the canonical term name (becomes the JSON key in `confirmed_terms`) and a stable kebab-case `id`.
2. Pick `casing` (`standard` / `proper` / `uppercase` / `fixed`) -- see `docs/data-shape.md` for the semantics.
3. Pick `script_rule`. If the term is a brand, project, person, programming language, OS, ticker, etc., consult `docs/translation-policy.md` §4 to choose the right value based on term role.
4. Add to `src/data/glossary-terms-enhanced.json` under `confirmed_terms` using the template.
5. Add per-language translation stubs under `src/data/translations/glossary-{lang}.json` for each of the 24 languages.
6. **Validate**: `npx tsc --noEmit`
7. **Test resolution locally**:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler dev --port 8787
   curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/v1/style-guide/<termId>
   curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/v1/translations/en/<termId>
   curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/v1/languages          # confirm stats unchanged
   ```
8. Report results. Wait for single-use permission before commit, then again before push.

## DRY pattern families -- do NOT add per-instance entries

Some identifiers follow a uniform programmatic format with hundreds of instances. **Never add per-instance master entries for these.** The rule is encoded once on the parent entry and `src/lib/content-filter.ts` pattern-matches the family at request time via `STANDARD_PATTERNS`.

Currently handled:

| Family  | Examples                                       | Parent master entry                       |
|---------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `ERC-N` | ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, ERC-4337, ERC-7702 | `ethereum request for comments (erc)`     |
| `EIP-N` | EIP-1559, EIP-4844, EIP-7702                  | `ethereum improvement proposal (eip)`     |

**To add a new family** (e.g. BIP-N, RIP-N, a new EIP/ERC variant):

1. Append a `StandardPattern` entry to `STANDARD_PATTERNS` in `src/lib/content-filter.ts` with the regex, parent term key, and surface-form normalizer.
2. Confirm the parent master entry exists and documents the always-Latin rule in its `note` field.
3. Verify with a `curl` to `/api/v1/filter` containing several instances of the family.

**Single instances that are NOT pattern members** (ETH ticker, BTC, USDC, DAI, individual specific tokens) stay as their own master entries -- they are individual standards, not pattern family members.

**Why this matters:** ERC and EIP each have hundreds of numbered instances. Adding entries per instance is duplicate work that does not scale and breaks the DRY principle. The pattern-matching approach handles every current and future instance with zero data changes.

## Translation and transliteration decisions

For any question about how a term should render in a non-Latin-script language -- script choice, transliteration vs calque, brand handling, numerals, plurals -- load `docs/translation-policy.md`. It is the v1-locked policy (2026-05-10) synthesized from prior linguistic guidance and validated by two parallel Gemini 3.1 Pro analyses with explicit disagreement resolution.

Quick lookup before loading the full policy:

- **Non-Latin scripts in scope:** `ar, bn, hi, ja, ko, mr, ru, ta, te, uk, ur, zh, zh-tw`
- **Latin scripts (transliteration N/A):** `cs, de, es, fr, id, it, pl, pt-br, sw, tr, vi`
- **Term roles** (informs default `script_rule`): `concept`, `brand-or-project`, `person-name`, `programming-language`, `os-platform`, `cryptographic-primitive`, `network-name`, `file-extension`, `cli-command`, `ticker-or-standard`, `identifier`
- **`script_rule` values in the v1 policy**: `translate`, `calque`, `transliterate`, `keep_latin`, `always_latin`, `transliterate_with_translation`
- **Globally `always_latin`** across all 13 non-Latin-script languages: tickers (ETH, BTC), token standards (ERC-20), improvement proposals (EIP-1559), RPC/protocol identifiers, crypto primitives (Keccak256), network parameters with units (32 ETH, 1 Gwei).

## Common workflows

### Local development

```bash
pnpm install                       # uses --ignore-workspace via empty pnpm-workspace.yaml
pnpm dev                           # builds assets, then wrangler dev on 127.0.0.1
```

**Use `pnpm dev`, not bare `wrangler dev`.** The stylesheet is a build
artifact; starting the worker without building first serves a page with no
CSS at all. The build output IS committed so a fresh clone renders, but it
goes stale the moment you edit a class -- `pnpm dev` keeps it honest.

SSH-tunnel for remote dev (use `127.0.0.1`, not `localhost`):
```bash
ssh -L 8787:127.0.0.1:8787 host
```

### Type check
```bash
pnpm run check     # tsc --noEmit
```

Run `npx wrangler types --env-interface CloudflareBindings` first on a fresh
clone -- `worker-configuration.d.ts` is gitignored and `tsc` fails without it.

### Build the viewer assets
```bash
pnpm run build          # fonts + css
```

`dev` and `deploy` both run this first, so you rarely call it directly. The
two steps are independent:

- `build:fonts` regenerates `src/ui/fonts.css` and repopulates `public/fonts/`
  from the `@fontsource` packages. Fonts are self-hosted -- never link a CDN.
- `build:css` compiles `src/ui/app.css` to `public/assets/app.css` with
  Tailwind. **Editing a class in a `.tsx` requires a rebuild to take effect.**
  The output is committed (so a clone renders without a build) and is left
  unminified on purpose, so the diff is reviewable. Cloudflare compresses it
  in transit either way. Rebuild and commit it whenever classes change.

### Audit data against v1 policy
```bash
node scripts/audit-glossary.mjs > /tmp/audit-report.md
```

### Verify a deploy
```bash
scripts/verify-deploy.sh https://ethglossary.visual-20-hoists.workers.dev
scripts/verify-deploy.sh http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

### Deploy to production
```bash
npx wrangler deploy --minify
```

Requires `npx wrangler login` once per machine (OAuth flow needs port 8976 forwarded for SSH sessions).

### Push to GitHub

If working from a worktree of another repo, the remote is named `ethglossary` (not `origin`). Push the local branch as the repo's default branch:

```bash
git push ethglossary <local-branch>:main
```

Only push after explicit single-use approval. Never combine commit and push.

## First moves on session start

1. Read this AGENTS.md end-to-end.
2. Run `git status` and `git log --oneline | head` to know where things stand.
3. Never commit, push, or deploy without explicit single-use approval.
4. If asked to do something that touches glossary data, the `script_rule` enum, the `category` field, or translation policy, load the relevant doc before editing.
