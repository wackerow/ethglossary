/**
 * Renders an imported .svg file inline.
 *
 * Import the glyph where you use it and pass it in:
 *
 *   import thumbsUp from "lucide-static/icons/thumbs-up.svg"
 *   <Icon svg={thumbsUp} class="size-4" />
 *
 * Lucide's files already carry `stroke="currentColor"`, so color comes from
 * the surrounding text color for free. Sizing is a Tailwind class on the
 * wrapper; the svg fills its height and keeps its own aspect ratio, so a
 * non-square mark like the wordmark is not squashed.
 *
 * The `.icon` base sits in the components layer (see app.css), so a caller's
 * `hidden` or `lg:block` beats it rather than tying with it.
 *
 * Custom artwork Lucide does not ship -- the brand marks and the decorative
 * glyphs -- lives in ./icons and imports exactly the same way.
